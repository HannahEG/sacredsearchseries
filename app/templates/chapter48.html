            </div>

            <div><h5>Chapter 4:</h5> 
              <p style="color:blueviolet"> 1. Girls: Why do you think the same women who, as girlfriends, often defended their boyfriends, 
              now, as wives, often complain about the same men who have become their husbands? 
              What is going on here?
              <br><br><i>- Acts 6:3 Choose men who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom.
              <br>- 1 Peter 5:8 Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
             <br><br></i>
              2. Girls: If we know that men are disposed to  be impressed or impacted by physical looks, 
              how can we honor them and avoid manipulating men with our bodies and/or charm? 
              How can we guard our brother's hearts? 
              <br><br></p><br>

              <p style="color:blue">1. Guys: Given that men are biologically predisposed to be impressed with physical beauty, 
                how can they base the decision to marry on a woman's qualities that will outlast physical appearance? Is this a realistic question to ask?
               <i><br><br>- 1 Peter 5:8 Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
                <br>- Proverbs 31:30 Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
                <br>- Proverbs 12:4 An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, But she who causes shame is like rottenness in his bones.
              </i> 
                <br><br>2. Guys: What does it look like for us to guard our sister's hearts, knowing women are predisposed to emotional connections? 
                What does it look like to be genuine and transparent within a dating relationship with our characters and flaws?
              </p><br>

              3. <b>Guys/Girls: False advertising? Practically, what does it look like to walk in integrity toward men/women, respectively? 
              </b><br><br> <br>

              <h5>Chapter 8:</h5>

              1. Do you think it is wise to marry someone you highly respect and enjoy being around, 
              but for whom you don't have intense feelings of infatuation?<br><br>

              2. What are motives, such as financial security, for why or when people get married? What is a good balance?
              <br><br>
              3. What does the Bible say about sex and marriage? <br>
              <i>Look up verses and discuss (1 Corinthians 6:15-20, 1 Corin 7:36-38, 1 Thess. 4:3-7, Hebrews 13:4) pg 84
              <br></i><br>
              
              4. How can someone be motivated by sexual desire but not ruled by it when actively pursuing marriage?<br>
              <i><br>- 1 Corinthians 7:9 but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion
              <br>- Proverbs 5:18-19 Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice with the wife of your youth. 
              As a loving deer and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; And always be enraptured with her love.
              </i><br><br><br>
