              <div><h5>Chapter 9:</h5> 
              <br>

              1. What style of marriage best describes the kind of marriage you've always imagined having? Or which aspects of the listed "styles" describe your ideal relationship?
            <br><br>2. What is the significance of honestly and intentionally determining my own and my potential/current partner's marriage assumptions? How important or is it important to agree on some or all of these aspects? 
            <br><br>3. What are your thoughts about the statement that breaking off a relationship when these considerations don't or can't align is "the most loving thing you can do?" (pg 113)
                      
                <br><br><br>
  

                  <h5>Chapter 10:</h5>

                1. How would you rank the importance of the four aspects described in this chapter: character, parenting potential, extended family, and spiritual humility? What are the values of each when making potential marriage or relationship decision?

    <br><br><b>(Note on family: A person's family will have an impact on our married life. This is a realistic expectation. Also, it harmful to falsely assume a person's family is perfect or can be "completing." This is not a realistic expectation.

        <br><br>Note on mental illness: sensitive topic, people in the group who either have struggled with mental health or have close family who struggle with mental health. This is wise to be upfront about with a potential partner, while it may not preclude someone from being a strong or healthy partner it is like any other important topic to discuss.)
                  </b>
        <br><br>2. If anyone can enjoy a movie, a hike, coffee conversation, or making out, then how important is a person's spiritual growth when deciding on a relationship or marriage? How does this apply to me and my own spiritual growth?
                  
        <br><br>3. Discuss the following verses from Proverbs and how they are important when evaluating "building a family.""

              <br><br><i>Proverbs 24:3-7 By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches. A wise man is full of strength, and a man of knowledge enhances his might, for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory. Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the gate he does not open his mouth.
            
              <br><br>Proverbs 12:15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice.
            
              <br><br>Proverbs 29:11 A fool gives full vent to his spirit, but a wise man quietly holds it back.</i>
